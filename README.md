# url-shortener-challenge

This repository contains a very basic implementation of an in-memory URL shortener. It was done for a job interview programming challenge, which was to build a URL shortener in a stack or langauge that you are unfamiliar with. This is me experimenting with Go, over the course of 3-6 hours, and minimal prior experience (I could already read Go to some extent).

This code is purely just here for reference, and not intended to be production-ready or even ever used.
